        <p>"With his 1971 debut, the appropriately and humbly titled "Just as I Am," Bill Withers emerged from nowhere and immediately established himself as one of the most distinctive voices in soul music known for his humble character and equally humble and yet humble arrangements. his serious but realistic narrative. lyrics, and a generally sunny sound, even when it comes to dark themes. Each track is a little cinematic vignette, his own little story / movie and he continually draws us in with iconic classics like Ain't No Sunshine and Grandma's Hands and lesser known album tracks like Hope She'll be Happier, the astonishingly hard-hitting Im Her. Daddy, and the surprisingly grown-up Moanin 'and Groanin' and Better Off Dead, an astonishing tale of an alcoholic who falls into a downward spiral before finally committing suicide, signified by an abrupt ending with a gunshot."</p>

        <p>"Few singers have possessed such a rich and comforting baritone as that of Bill Withers. Even fewer in number are the composers who have shared West Virginia's natural ability to articulate a wide range of emotions and perspectives - joy and gratitude, jealousy and resentment - with maximum levels of conviction and conciseness. It was late, the common R&B paragon had just turned 33 when "Ain't No Sunshine," the uninterrupted ballad from Just as I Am (1971), turned it into a sudden and unlikely success story, in a mechanic year.

        <p>For the next ten years, Withers continued to blend soul, gospel, folk, and funk with unusual finesse. He collected more gold singles with "Lean on Me" and "Use Me", both from the equally successful Still Bill (1972), reached the same height with Menagerie (1977), directed by "Lovely Day", and received a second Grammy. for "Just the Two of Us" (1981), his collaboration with Grover Washington, Jr. Leaving early, Withers made his final statement with Watching You Watching Me (1985), closing out a songbook that has served as a bountiful resource for artists. from a multitude of stylistic trends. With his flowers before his death at the age of 81, Withers was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."</p>
